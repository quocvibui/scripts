What I have done:

- Create a virtual env using "python3.8 -m venv midi" -- 3.8 is for dependency issues
- Run "source midi/bin/activate"
- Installed "pip install mido" to control midi keyboards
- For installing p5, git clone the project source code, go to requirements.txt and delete:
  PyOpenGL-accelerate==3.1.7 ... This package seems most likely as an optimization package for speed
- Then do: pip install p5 --no-dependencies
https://github.com/p5py/p5/issues/439
  
Note, as of now, there doesn't seem to be any quick fixes for the problem on mac sillicon, so this
will have to work for now as a proof of concept ... I also tried on my other device, but the package
pyopengl-accelerate is not well-maintained for latest version of python and evern this one ... If 
I encouter problems, I will try to really figure it out.

While working with p5:
- Stop yabai: yabai --stop-service
- To restart: yabai --start-service
* A bit disappointing but it is what it is. This is not solvable, as yabai registered this as the
terminal app, so I can't locally disable the window

Other librarie installed: python-rtmidi
